# Cobra-OS
Welcome to Cobra OS, a operating inspired by Linux and MSDOS, with some GUI tools like the Snake game or the text editor.
I made this project because I'm learning python and want to explore all of its capabilities, therefore I must advice: the OS has **NO REAL USE** whatsoever.
The OS is also  UNSAFE, because it doesn't protect your files from anyone smart enough to access your file explorer.  
Don't worry if you find some errors along the way *(especially in the calculator...)*, With the Entire OS being essentially an App, your system will remain unharmed.

If you like the OS don't hesitate to drop a star and to follow me on my socials! (links in Bio)



## How to access?
**ATTENTION: The procidure is only made for Linux devices.**

To access to the OS, you have to **Download** the .tar.gz file and **extract the Cobra OS folder**, then, head to the terminal and enter the folder. When you are in the folder,
initialize the virtual environment (venv) by typing:

```

source venv/bin/activate

```
Once you have made that, type:

```
python3 Main_intarface.py
```
And you're good to go!

(Yes, I know i misspelled interface)

## Can I do whatever I want with the code?
Yes you can, it is stated in the MIT license.

## Can I contribute?
Yes. 

## Any common bugs I should be aware of?
An error will ocurr when you type anything but a number in the calculator, or when you try to divide by 0.
I don't know any other bugs, if you find them, tag me on Mastodon with a photo of the error.
